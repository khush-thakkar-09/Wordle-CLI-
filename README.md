# Wordle (Python CLI)

This project is a **command-line version of the popular Wordle game**, built entirely in Python.  
The goal is to guess a randomly chosen 5-letter word within 6 attempts.  
After each guess, the game provides feedback:  
- ðŸŸ© Green â†’ correct letter in the correct spot  
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â†’ correct letter but wrong spot  
- â¬œ Gray â†’ letter not in the word  

The project helped me practice important programming concepts such as **file handling, randomization, dictionaries, loops, and conditional logic**.
